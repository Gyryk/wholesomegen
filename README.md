A website that shows you a bunch of cute pictures of animals that I've scraped from the internet.

Just here to maybe improve someone's day, probably mine lol.

There is a webscraper that gets a bunch of links for the images and then they're used to output the image later, I probably could have better integrated the 2 together but honestly this was just supposed to be a tiny project in the first place and I don't even know why I kept adding features ðŸ’€

The script chooses a random line from the links file and then outputs the image from there onto the website for your happiness meter to go up

> I recently noticed the script just stopped working, the fix is on the todo list. Sorry ðŸ˜­
